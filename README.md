### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I am **kariuki chege**. I write code that runs on supercomputers to process data for very big telescopes like [LOFAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Frequency_Array_(LOFAR)) and [MWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_Widefield_Array).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [nextleap](https://github.com/kariukic/nextleap), a nextflow pipeline to process petabytes of data observed by LOFAR, a European radio telescope as part of my astronomy research.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills and technologies in programming, AI, data science, data engineering and general software development.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with open-source projects especially ones solving interesting and impactful problems
- âš¡ Fun fact: Kariuki has often been confused with karaoke, but the two words are vastly different in meaning and origin. Kariuki is an East African Gikuyu name which means `the reincarnated one'.
