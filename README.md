### Hi there 👋
- I am **kariuki chege**.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **nextleap**, a nextflow pipeline to process petabytes of data observed by LOFAR, a European radio telescope as part of my astronomy research.
- 🌱 I’m always looking to learn new skills and technologies in programming, AI, data science, data engineering and general software development.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate with open-source projects especially ones solving interesting and impactful problems
- ⚡ Fun fact: Kariuki has often been confused with karaoke, but the two words are vastly different in meaning and origin. Kariuki is an East African Gikuyu name which means `the reincarnated one'.
